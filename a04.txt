1. Jump into "$HOME/$USER/nokia-iv/" directory.
2. Copy "$HOME/$USER/nokia-iv/linux/info.sh" to "~/$USER/nokia-iv/bash/"
   directory.
3. Open any text editor you know and add below text at the very top of
   "info.sh" file:

#!/bin/bash

# This is simple sysinfo bash script written for testing purposes.

4. Save changes and close text editor.
5* Make the "info.sh" file executable (in other words: add executable
   permissions to "info.sh" file).
6. Congratulations! You have just created your first bash script! :)
7* Now, run this script to see how it works.
8** Run the script again but this time redirect its results to file named
    "~/$USER/nokia-iv/bash/info.log"
9. Display the content of "info.log file"
10** Create you account on github (https://github.com) portal.  Please use the
     name "edytarudnik".  The final link to your github profile should be
     https://github.com/edytarudnik
11. Check what is the "git" version installed in your system.
12* If you don't have a "git" installed, please install it.

Please note: all steps marked with one or more "*" are considered as slightly
more difficult for beginners.

Have a nice development && good luck! :)
